# CloudTaskResearch

Research material and test code for a research paper on cloud task scheduling.

Taking the HAMM algorithm (Hybrid MinMin and MaxMin) for task scheduling and adding an additional rebalancing step. This results in a reduction in variance of loads between all machines, and also can potentially reduce the overall makespan.
